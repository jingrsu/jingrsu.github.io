<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computing (COMP) at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). I am fortunately advised by under the upervision of [Prof. Qing Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csqli/) and [Prof. Zhaoxiang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qxWfV6cAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I received my bachelor and master degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University.

My research interest includes MLLM and Agent.
